<body>
<p>
<b>50-55% of carbohydrates</b><br>
whole grains, broken wheat, red/brown rice, oats, jaw(barley)
</p>

<p>
<b>25-30% of protein</b><br>
eggs, Paneer(cottage cheese), milk and milk products and skinless chicken and mutton
</p>

<p>
<b>15-20% of fat</b><br>
olive oil, sunflower + rice bran oil or other such MUFA and PUFA combination of oil.
Include healthy nuts, fish oil and Avocados
</p>
<p>
<b>Vitamins</b><br>
Vitamin E, B, C are all antioxidants and very essential to take care of the waste that is generated in the body due to strength training.
</p>


<p>
Vitamin E - Almonds, peanut, hazelnuts, Wheat germ (jau), flax seeds, sunflower oil , corn oil , canola oil
<br><br>
Vitamin C - Amla, Lemon, Papaya, oranges, bell pepper, pineapple, cantaloupe, kiwi, tomatoes , asparagus, Grape fruit , rasberries , fennel seeds (saunf)
<br><br>
Vitamin B - Legumes , pulses , beans , banana, chili, Milk  etc. You can also pop some B vitamin pills every day before workout. B vitamins are water soluble vitamin and the excess is washed off in urine , hence toxicity is the least expected. While supplementation will enhance your health and fitness.
</p>

<p>
<b>Fruits and vegetables</b><br>
They have ample amounts of vitamins and minerals packed in them, but you may need to re-consider some options or fit them in a plan so as to ensure their optimal intake while controlling excess consumption. This again enforces the focus of this article- eating the right food, in the right quantity, and at the right time.
<br><br>
Grape fruit, alfalfa and catfish provide HMB  which helps during workout  by sparing proteins and using carbohydrates and fat as energy.
<br><br>
Melons, pineapple and cantaloupe increase urination and flush off the excess metabolic waste produced in the body while building up muscles.
<br><br>
Vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, leafy greens, and yellow and red bell peppers are specially important if you are someone with sense of taste as well as health. Besides adding incredible taste to your delicacies, these vegetables provide ample amount of vital nutrients to your body while allow your muscles to heal faster after workout.
</p>

<p>
<b>Get enough Sleep</b>
<br>
In our desire to gain Muscles, we often forget that the tired cells of the body need enough rest for repair purpose. We tend to get over involved in the exercise routine and day to day work , that we ignore the 8 hour sleep required by every cell of the body desperately. As a result, you will notice a down fall in your stamina and some weak hearted may even give up. Do not let this happen to you. Basic as it may sound but reward your hard work at gym and outside by going for that much needed 7 – 8 hours of sleep. Power naps in the afternoon are encouraged too.
</p>

<p>
<b>Drink a lot of water</b>
<br>
water is essential for life. Water is the most essential part of an Indian diet plan for bodybuilding too. It is essential for Indian muscle builders and anyone who is involved in extreme and meticulous training or workout.  Water is absorbed quickly by the body cells and help in cooling down of the body cells after a vigorous workout. Plain water is considered of higher importance and of much value in comparison to most of the sports drinks that are sugar laden.  Good hydration also affects stamina and increases your muscles capacity to workout.
<br><br>
Increased urination is of utmost importance to ensure the elimination of the excess metabolic waste produced in the body during bodybuilding.
<br><br>
We dont believe that you should starve or compromise on your taste in your attempt to become a man with tough body, but we do believe that you should enjoy your diet and your workout at the same time. Thats why we have sketched out this Indian diet plan for bodybuilding that allows you to stick to your family’s eating patterns while allowing you to get the maximum out of your diet. Here is a sample Indian diet plan for muscle building. We have given proper substitute for every non- veg item mentioned in the diet plan to ensure that our Vegetarian bodybuilders can gain all the required nutrients too.

<p>
We do not ask you to eat bland food as we do not like it either. An aloo paratha in the morning or a chicken sandwich as an evening snack are incredible options provided you know how to consume them and where to stop. You cannot afford to have butter-laden parathas and you need to necessarily use brown bread in your chicken sandwich. And your juices need to be healthy drinks with little or no refined sugar content. That’s the way it works and you have to balance both the sides to make your plan more sustainable and to stay committed to it.
